# Seism-O
Simple near-surface refraction/reflection simulation programs for Octave and Matlab 

At this point this is just a collection of near-surface geophysics refraction/reflection seismic scripts that I have ben using for teaching. The scripts all run on Octave and Matlab.

At a later point I will provide documentation, (similar to [GPR-O](http://github.com/AlainPlattner/GPR-O))

The simplest way of obtaining these scripts and keeping them updated is by using git from the command prompt/terminal:

1) Install git:

https://git-scm.com/downloads

2) Open a command prompt / terminal, switch to the folder in which you want to install the software, and run

`git clone http://github.com/AlainPlattner/Seism-O.git`
