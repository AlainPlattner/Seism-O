# Seism-O
Simple near-surface refraction/reflection simulation programs for Octave (https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) and Matlab 

At this point this is just a collection of near-surface geophysics refraction/reflection seismic scripts that I have been using for teaching. The scripts all run on Octave and Matlab.

At a later point I will provide documentation, (similar to [GPR-O](http://github.com/NSGeophysics/GPR-O))

The simplest way of obtaining these scripts and keeping them updated is by using git from the command prompt/terminal:

1) Install git:

https://git-scm.com/downloads

2) Open a command prompt / terminal, switch to the folder in which you want to install the software, and run

`git clone http://github.com/NSGeophysics/Seism-O.git`

To keep the scripts updated, run, from time to time run 

`git pull origin master`

on the command line in the folder `Seism-O`.

Please consider contributing to this repository by creating your own teaching activities or code improvements/additions. You can add them by using git fork and then send me a pull-request, or you can just send them to me via email and I put them online.
